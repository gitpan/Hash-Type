Hash/Type version 1.05
======================

Hash::Type - pseudo-hashes as arrays tied to a "type" (list of fields)

A Hash::Type is a collection of field names.
Internally, an index is associated with each name.
Such collections are created dynamically and can be extended.
They are used to build tied hashes, either through C<tie>
or through object-oriented method calls; such tied hashes :

- are 'restricted' (will only accept operations on names previously 
  declared in their Hash::Type)

- are implemented internally as arrays (so they use less memory)

- can be sorted efficiently through comparison functions generated
  and compiled by the class

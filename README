Hash/Type version 1.0
=====================

Hash::Type - pseudo-hashes as arrays tied to a "type" (list of fields)

A Hash::Type is a collection of field names.
Internally, an index is associated with each name.
Such collections are created dynamically and can be extended.
They are used to build tied hashes, either through C<tie>
or through object-oriented method calls.
